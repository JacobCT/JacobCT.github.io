On this page I will post my finished projects. This includes smaller research projects, class projects or things I have done for fun. (Click on the image for full PDF)

### Class Projects
#### Observational Astronomy 2021
##### - Green Bank HI Data

Abstract: We aim to use data from M33, the Triangulum galaxy, taken from the Green Bank Telescope in
2017 to analyze the HI line. This data was analyzed to determine that the galaxy is spinning counter-
clockwise in relation to the observing position while the entire galaxy is moving towards the observer.
From this data, the mass of M33 was was determined to be around 10\^11 solar masses. Moment analysis was
also done in order to interpret the nature of the 3-D data.

##### - Analyzing X-ray Data

Abstract: We aim to use Chandra Telescope X-Ray data from PSR J0835-4510, the Vela Pulsar, taken with
the Chandra X-Ray Telescope in August 2010 to compute a spectral analysis. The data were separated
by soft x-rays and hard x-rays to then analyze the spatial distribution of their ratio which resulted in
a value of 0.03. The emission mechanisms of the systems were also analyzed and discussed with the
most likely sources being electronic transitions for the soft energies and synchrotron radiation for the
hard energies.

##### - Astronomical Catalogs

Abstract: In this project, data has been taken from the 2MASS infrared survey, which provided the students
with data from infrared point sources from the entire sky which could then be analyzed to look at
different properties of different groups of stars. For this project instead of looking at specific already
determined objects, we will be looking at a specific subgroup of object which stick out from the rest
of the data and determine the type of object based on their properties. The best way to look at
this data will most likely be a color-color diagram, which will then be able to help us indicate where
certain stars lie in relation to the main sequence. From our results, we conclude that the population
we have selected have low H-K values and J-H values which lie around 0.6. It is likely that these point
sources are stars which have fallen off the main sequence and are at the last moments of their life-cycle.
However, this cannot be said with certainty and would need to be investigated further.

##### - Final Project, Astro Photography

Abstract: This project had the goal of observing the Orion Nebula using the White Hall Telescope and calibrat-
ing the image in order to produce a high quality detection. The detection was made, then calibrated
to reduce noise and create a clear picture. The noise factors were discussed, and a comparison between
wavelengths was made which showed that the visible range which was observed is highly effcient at
detecting gas from the nebula.

#### Optics 2021
For this project, we were given the instructions to explain how the optical physics behind a certain instrument works. This was to be a four page poster which explained the instrument in a clear and consice manner while at the same time using multiple diagrams to help with the understanding. The project was done with my classmate Julia Nilton and we chose the CHIME Telescope as our project's topic.

### Astronomy Club

### Other
- I took a library research class in my senior year of undergrad. In this class we had to create a fun little infographic, so here's my infographic on quantum entanglement:
