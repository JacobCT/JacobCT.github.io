On this page I will post my finished projects. This includes smaller research projects, class projects or things I have done for fun.

### Class Projecs
#### Observational Astronomy 2021
##### Green Bank HI Data
Abstract: We aim to use data from M33, the Triangulum galaxy, taken from the Green Bank Telescope in
2017 to analyze the HI line. This data was analyzed to determine that the galaxy is spinning counter-
clockwise in relation to the observing position while the entire galaxy is moving towards the observer.
From this data, the mass of M33 was was determined to be around 10\^11 solar masses. Moment analysis was
also done in order to interpret the nature of the 3-D data.

##### Final Project, Astro Photography
Abstract: This project had the goal of observing the Orion Nebula using the White Hall Telescope and calibrat-
ing the image in order to produce a high quality detection. The detection was made, then calibrated
to reduce noise and create a clear picture. The noise factors were discussed, and a comparison between
wavelengths was made which showed that the visible range which was observed is highly effcient at
detecting gas from the nebula.
