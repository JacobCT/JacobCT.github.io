Although nowadays you will also find me in the climbing gym or going on casual runs, I have had a deep love for the sport of diving for over 10 years,
which I continue to practice a few times a week. I have trained diving competitively since I was eleven, qualifying four times to the Canadian junior 
national championships and many more times for the senior national championships. While completing my undergraduate degree at West Virginia University, 
I was recruited and received an athletic scholarship to compete on their NCAA division I Swimming and Diving team. I value this time of my life quite fondly
as it taught me many important skills which continue to be important in my academic work.
