# Research

My research focuses on Pulsars and FRBs. In my projects I have used data from many important radio telescopes, such as Arecibo, CHIME, Greenbank, and the Very Large Array in order to study different pulsars and their specific properties. I simulate data and use this to predict properties which should be seen by these telescopes and help best determine how we should by observing certain pulsars. The majority of my work is done in collaboration with the Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), in order to help them make the discovery of gravitational waves using Pulsar Timing Arrays.
  

The following is a brief description of the research projects I have worked on.

### - Optimal Frequency Channelization for Pulsar Dispersion Measurements
This projected is one of the projects I am currently working on and is somewhat of a follow-up to the Pulsar Dispersion Measure project I worked on during the summer of 2020. Once observation data is taken, and before it is analyzed, it is important to determine the number of frequency channels with which to “scrunch” the data. Depending on the telescope, data are scrunched to powers of 2 all the way up to 2048. Because the number of frequency channels used can impact the uncertainty in the dispersion measure, it is important to choose what number of frequency channels is best. The higher the number of frequency channels we use, the better our resolution will be. However, this comes at a cost to the signal to noise ratio (SNR) which will decrease. In order to have a low error in DM we need to find the number of channels which has the highest resolution while at the same time being bright enough as to not affect the uncertainty. We expect the optimal number of frequency channels to change relative to the pulsar and the instrument used. This is because of many factors, such as the intrinsic characteristics of the telescope used, or even characteristics of the signal itself, such as the brightness or the shape of the signal produced by the pulsar. All data for this project is being simulated from GBT or Arecibo data using the Pulsar Signal Simulator, and a paper is currently being develloped in the hopes that this work will be published soon. 

### - Comprehensive Analysis of a Dense Sample of FRB 121102 Bursts
In this paper, we presented an analysis of a densely repeating sample of bursts from the first repeating fast radio burst, FRB 121102. We reanalysed the data used by Gourdji et al. (2019) and detected 93 additional bursts using our single-pulse search pipeline. Most of my contribution to this work was in the long term periodicity search. I used the Lomb-Scargle Periodicity algorithm to search the data for any trends which would show any signs of periodicity in the range of 100ms-1000s. However, no significant periodicity was detected in the LS search or any other of our search methods.
