Hello and welcome to my personal website! I am currently a PhD student in astrophysics at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute). I graduated from West Virginia University in 2021 with a BSc in physics and from the University of Bonn in 2024 with an MSc in astrophysics, where I carried out my MSc thesis project at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. 

I like researching some of the most extreme objects and phenomena in the sky using radio telescopes. My focus is on pulsars, gravitational waves, and FRBs. Most of my projects involve performing observations, RFI mitigation and data analysis on these observations, searches for gravitational waves, or even simulations of pulsar signals.

On this website you will find a description of my research, including examples of my full work. You may also learn about topics which interest me the most, in and out of the world of astronomy.
