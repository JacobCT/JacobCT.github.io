Hello and welcome to my personal website! I am currently a graduate student in astrophysics at the University of Bonn. I graduated from West Virginia University with a BSc in physics in 2021 and originally from Ottawa, Canada. I like to research some of the most extreme objects in the sky using massive radio telescopes. Namely pulsars, FRBs and gravitational waves.

On this website you will find a description of my research, including examples of my full work. You may also find which topics interest me the most, in and out of the world of astronomy.
