Hello and welcome to my personal website! I am currently a graduate student in astrophysics at the University of Bonn / Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. I graduated from West Virginia University in 2021 with a BSc in physics and I am originally from Ottawa, Canada. I like to research some of the most extreme objects in the sky using massive radio telescopes. Namely pulsars, FRBs and gravitational waves.

On this website you will find a description of my research, including examples of my full work. You may also learn about topics which interest me the most, in and out of the world of astronomy.
